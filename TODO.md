# aspen to-do list

This list will be broken into 2 categories: 
<ul>
	<li>Fixes/improvements for existing code (let's call these <strong>"past"</strong>)</li>
	<li>Ideas for new code to add to aspen(let's call these <strong>"future"</strong>)</li>
</ul>

When adding to this list, please be as expressive as necessary to convey your idea - feel free to attach code snippets, pictures, etc. - but be sure to cateogirze as past or future. That way we can look out for recurring themes/ideas. Thanks!

## Future

- Option to generate an empty file within each directory
    - Purpose of this: Git doesn't track empty directories, hence you cannot push your nice folder structure template up to Github - a feature which would be really useful.
